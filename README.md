A template for Call for Code starter kits which help understand a real-world challenge under the Climate Change theme in 2021. These templates can be used to capture the output of the Design Thinking workshop in February and demonstrate a potential technology solution for that problem.

## Short description

### What's the problem?

8.9% of the global population is suffering from hunger. The UN Sustainable Development Goal #2 of Zero Hunger sets ambitious targets to profoundly change the global food and agriculture system and give more people a regular access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food to reach zero hunger by 2030. 

Much of the worldâ€™s food is grown by small scale independent farms and distributed through local community co-operatives who sell the surplus produce. The co-ops are a central point for quality control, deliveries and enabling food commodity markets. These co-ops face a myriad of logistical challenges to get the right food, to the right places, with minimal time and cost. 

### How can technology help?

By bringing the paper ledgers of food co-ops online, the communities can harness data insights from their environment for better crop resilience and overall yield for sustainable food production systems at the grassroots. More crops mean better access to food for the community.
Rural farmers may not have the access to network connectivity, digital literacy, language or appetite for risk to adopt tech solutions directly, so the co-ops become the pivotal point of innovation. 

### The idea

Co-operative systems can be digitised and enhanced to improve access to nutritious food in local communities (especially those suffering from acute hunger). By aggregating and analysing market, transport, demand, horticultural and environmental data they can optimise productivity, reduce overheads and decrease volatility in the supply chain of these farming communities that can address the global hunger crisis.

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file. [Learn how to build apps on the IBM Cloud](#platform-development).
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text. [Learn about IBM artificial intelligence](#artificial-intelligence).
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language. [Learn about IBM artificial intelligence](#artificial-intelligence).
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage. [Learn about IBM data science](#data-science).

## Getting started
