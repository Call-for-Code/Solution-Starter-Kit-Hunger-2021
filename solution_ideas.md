# Solution Ideas

This is a list of potential solutions that teams can use the Zero Hunger starter kit to implement. Please feel free to use these ideas, or develop an idea of your own. The goals are measurable

## Solution idea: Image Sharing

Farmers use non-smartphones to communicate and create a database of information that can be used to analyze trends.

```diff
! A co-operative
+ can aggregate data from farmers via phone cameras and sms to analyze the data 
- in order to optimize productivity by 30% through knowledge sharing.
```

To implement this solution, you can use the SMS gateway integration provided by the starter kit to allow farmers to send messages and images to a central database, e.g. Cloudant and IBM Cloud Object Storage. You could further analyze the information using IBM Cloud Pak for Data's Watson AI/ML offerings.

## Solution idea: Accounting & Credits

Farmers work with co-operatives to get credit for their goods.

```diff
! A co-operative
+ can manage farmersâ€™ accounts, including credits, to facilitate trade and distribution of funds in order 
- to create transparency among transactions and reducing overhead and labor
```

In order to implement this solution, you can use the SMS gateway integration provided by the starter kit to provide real-time messaging between farmers and cooperatives. As a stretch goal, you may find and aggregate real-time price & market data, and optionally integrate a distributed ledger, such as blockchain, to track transactions.
