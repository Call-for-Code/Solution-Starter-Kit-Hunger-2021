# Solution Ideas

This is a list of potential solutions that teams can use the Zero Hunger starter kit to implement. Please feel free to use these ideas, or develop an idea of your own.

## Solution idea: Image Sharing

Farmers use non-smartphones to communicate

```diff
! A co-operative
+ can aggregate data from farmers via phone cameras and sms to analyze the data 
- in order to optimize productivity by 30% through knowledge sharing.
```

TBD

## Solution idea: Accounting & Credits

Farmers work with co-operatives to get credit for their goods.

```diff
! A co-operative
+ can manage farmersâ€™ accounts, including credits, to facilitate trade and distribution of funds in order 
- to create transparency among transactions and reducing overhead and labor
```

In order to implement this solution, you can use the SMS gateway integration provided by the starter kit to provide real-time messaging between farmers and cooperatives. As a stretch goal, you may find and aggregate real-time price & market data, and optionally integrate a distributed ledger, such as blockchain, to track transactions.
